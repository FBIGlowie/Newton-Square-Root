# Newton-Square-Root

This is my attempt at coding with advanced math and today I will make a square root finder using some formula made by an important person in history who got a dent in his skull by a falling apple. 



Ofc I am not gonna try to use any sort of cringe library because real programmers implement stuff themselves, no need for noob skill issue "use cringe::lib::{That shortens the coding time from 8 hours to 30 minutes}" type trash
